# *Blockchain With Python*

# Step 4 of the Homework:
## Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records <br/>

### Test your complete `PyChain` ledger and user interface by running your
### Streamlit application and storing some mined blocks in your `PyChain` ledger.
### Then test the blockchain validation process by using your `PyChain` ledger.
### To do so, complete the following steps: <br/>

### 1. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where you've coded the
### Challenge. <br/>

### 2. In the terminal, run the Streamlit application by
### using `streamlit run pychain.py`.<br/>

### 3. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the "Add
### Block" button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger. <br/>

### 4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu.
### Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should detail a
### blockchain that consists of multiple blocks. Include the screenshot in the
### README.md` file for your Challenge repository. <br/>

### 5. Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface.
### Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should indicate
### the validity of the blockchain. Include the screenshot in the `README.md`
### file for your Challenge repository. <br/>
